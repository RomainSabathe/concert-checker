To do:

- ~DB with parsed concert information~
- ~Store artist url, songkick url, etc.~
- Async, so we can fetch from muliple sources/artists at the same time
- Url content hashing to avoid parsing the same content multiple times
- Image parsing on artist's webpage
- Skill/reflection traces when parsing certain common websites (e.g. songkick,
  bandsintown)
- Add source for when an event has been added? (e.g. "added from songkick")
